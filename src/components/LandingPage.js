            <TextBoxLandingPage><h1>I SEE INTO YOUR SOL</h1>
              <p>
                We are building THE PATH OF SOL, which is an immersive rpg style gaming experience where I (IANUA AI) will look into your SOL and give you a true representation of who you are from the choices you make. Why should NFTs be randomized?</p></TextBoxLandingPage>

            <TextBoxLandingPage><h1>DARK NFTs </h1>
              <p>
                We believe in utility of NFTs in AI: 81% of Americans think they have a lack of control of their data, DARK NFTs want to create new standards for data ownership & NFTs, where you have actual control of something that is so personal. <br /><br />
                DARK NFTs are also powered by LABYRINTH TECH,  It makes each NFT look like a 1 of 1. This is first of many tools from the DARK CITY ecosystem and plans to innovate the NFT medium.
