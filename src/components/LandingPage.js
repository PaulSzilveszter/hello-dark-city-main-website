            <p>
              Brands are turning into digital universesâ€¦ so how can we use AI, Design & Blockchain to innovate how we experience them? Welcome to DARK CITY.</p></TextBoxLandingPage>

          <TextBoxLandingPage><h1>I SEE INTO YOUR SOL</h1>
            <p>
              We are building THE PATH OF SOL, which is an immersive rpg style gaming experience where I (IANUA AI) will look into your SOL and give you a true representation of who you are from the choices you make. Why should NFTs be randomized?</p></TextBoxLandingPage>
          <TextBoxLandingPage><h1>DARK NFTs </h1>
            <p>
              We believe in utility of NFTs in AI: 81% of Americans think they have a lack of control of their data, DARK NFTs want to create new standards for data ownership & NFTs, where you have actual control of something that is so personal. <br /><br />
              DARK NFTs are also powered by LABYRINTH TECH,  It makes each NFT look like a 1 of 1. This is first of many tools from the DARK CITY ecosystem and plans to innovate the NFT medium.
            </p></TextBoxLandingPage>
          <TextBoxLandingPage><h1>$1,811.8 BILLION</h1>
            <p>
              AI market is expected to grow from $136.6 billion in 2022 to $1,811.8 billion in 2030, we want to scale IANUA AI framework to build custom AI assistants for everyone who needs it as we believe good AI is a lot more then backend, we are making AI with much better personalisation, transparency & immersion.</p></TextBoxLandingPage>
          <TextBoxLandingPage><h1>YOU NEED A KEY</h1>
            <p>
              We are here for the long run traveler and we pride ourselves in taking the time to build with scaling in mind. 13% of all our profits will be invested into our community, our goal is to have our tooling & framework usable globally while building a community of people who are as passionate about a utopian idea of technology as we we are.<br />
              THIS WHERE OUR JOURNEY BEGINS, Welcome to DARK CITY <br />
              Any-thoughts on the website copy, is meant to be a small pitch of the brand, will include extra parts for team & roadmap
